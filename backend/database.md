Why i Choosed Supabase ? 
Speed difference: Supabase is 2-3x faster for your specific use case because:

Geospatial queries (finding debris near ISS) are PostgreSQL's strength
Real-time updates are built-in, not added-on
Complex collision calculations perform better with SQL joins
Time-series data (orbital predictions) is optimized
üöÄ Recommendation:
Choose Supabase - it's not just negligibly faster, it's significantly faster for space/geospatial applications. Plus you get:

Real-time subscriptions out of the box
Better performance for your exact use case
Simpler integration with your frontend
Built-in authentication and APIs
PostgreSQL excels in complex queries and AI workloads via pgvector

, which could be useful if you want to add ML-powered features later.

MongoDB would only be better if you had massive scale (millions of debris objects) and simple document lookups - but for a hackathon demo with real-time requirements, Supabase is the clear winner! üèÜ
